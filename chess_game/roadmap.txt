# Chess Game Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- Define project goals & scope (console app, GUI, networked, AI, etc.)
- Choose programming language and libraries (e.g., Python + Rich for console)
- Set up development environment & version control (Git)

## Phase 2: Basic Board & Piece Representation
- Create a Board class (8x8 grid data structure)
- Define base Piece class (team, position, symbol)
- Create subclasses for each piece type (Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King)
- Implement piece initialization with starting positions

## Phase 3: Display & User Interface
- Implement board display with coordinates
- Add piece rendering with symbols and colors (use libraries like Rich)
- Add input handling for selecting and moving pieces

## Phase 4: Movement Logic
- Implement valid_moves() methods for each piece type
  - Pawn moves and captures (incl. en passant later)
  - Knightâ€™s L-shape moves
  - Bishop diagonal moves
  - Rook straight moves
  - Queen combined moves
  - King one-step moves (castling later)
- Validate moves based on current board state
- Highlight valid moves to user

## Phase 5: Game Mechanics
- Implement move execution & board state update
- Enforce turn order (white moves first, then black, alternating)
- Add checks for check and checkmate
- Add special moves:
  - Castling
  - Pawn promotion
  - En passant capture

## Phase 6: Additional Features
- Undo/redo moves
- Save/load game state
- Basic AI opponent or multiplayer support
- Timers / move clocks
- Improved UI/UX with animations or sound (if GUI)

## Phase 7: Testing & Debugging
- Write tests for piece movement rules
- Test edge cases (check, checkmate, stalemate)
- Fix bugs and polish gameplay

## Phase 8: Deployment & Documentation
- Package and distribute the game
- Write user manual or help guide
- Optionally open source the project or share online

### Tips:
- Build incrementally; test each phase thoroughly
- Keep code modular and readable
- Use version control commits per milestone
- Prioritize core gameplay before extras
